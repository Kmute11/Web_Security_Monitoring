# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability on Nigeria.PayU.com

## Overview
Identified and analyzed a critical Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability on the payment platform Nigeria.PayU.com. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially compromising sensitive payment information and user accounts.

## Details of the Vulnerability

### Attack Vector
The XSS vulnerability is exploitable via the "payment description" input field. Unsanitized user input is rendered directly on the transaction confirmation page, making it susceptible to script injection.

### Impact
- **User Account Compromise:** An attacker can steal session cookies, allowing unauthorized access to user accounts.
- **Data Theft:** Payment and user information could be exfiltrated.
- **Reputation Damage:** A successful exploit undermines user trust in the platform.

### Exploit Scenario
1. An attacker inputs a malicious script (`<script>alert('XSS')</script>`) into the payment description field.
2. The script executes when the transaction confirmation page is loaded, affecting any user viewing the page.

## Mitigation Steps
1. **Input Validation:** Implement strict validation rules to allow only alphanumeric characters and necessary symbols.
2. **Output Encoding:** Encode all user inputs before rendering them on web pages to prevent script execution.
3. **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Define a CSP header to restrict script execution from unauthorized sources.
4. **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct periodic reviews of input fields and other potential attack vectors.

## Tools Used for Analysis
- **Burp Suite:** For intercepting and analyzing HTTP requests.
- **OWASP ZAP:** To identify and exploit XSS vulnerabilities.
- **Splunk:** Monitored real-time activity and logs for any signs of exploitation attempts.

## Conclusion
Addressing this XSS vulnerability is critical to ensuring the integrity and security of Nigeria.PayU.com. By applying the recommended mitigation steps, the platform can safeguard its users against potential exploitation and enhance trust in its services.
